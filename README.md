<h1>A NETWORK SCANNER</h1>

<h2>PROJECT OVERVIEW </h2>
In the realm of network security, having a clear understanding of the devices connected to a network is crucial for maintaining its integrity and security. 
This project focuses on developing a Network Scanner tool specifically tailored to the task of discovering active clients on a network.

<h2> OBJECTIVE </h2>
Build a network scanner from scratch to gain a comprehensive understanding of how network scanners work, 
and the methodologies involved in discovering active clients on a network. Further strengthening my programming skills and use of the linux environment.


















<h2> CONCLUSION </h2>
Throughout this project, I encountered challenges, experimented with different techniques, and iteratively refined my implementation to achieve the desired outcome. 
From crafting probe packets to analyzing responses, every step of the process has contributed to my knowledge and expertise in network scanning and reconnaissance.
